# Simple-Chat


Project Description:
This is a simple client-server chat project implemented in Java, developed as part of an exercise during a bootcamp. The project consists of two parts: a client and a server. The client establishes a connection with the server and allows the user to send messages typed in the console. On the other hand, the server receives these messages and displays them in the console. The chat continues until the user types "exit" to end the conversation. This project can serve as a basic introduction to client-server communication in Java using sockets.

Technologies/Languages Used:
